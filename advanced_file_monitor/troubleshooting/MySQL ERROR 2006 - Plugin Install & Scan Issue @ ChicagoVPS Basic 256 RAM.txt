Error number: 2006
Error description: MySQL server has gone away

The MySQL server has gone away (error 2006) has two main causes and solutions:

(1) Server timed out and closed the connection.

	To fix, check that wait_timeout mysql variable in your my.cnf configuration file is large enough.

(2) Server dropped an incorrect or too large packet.

	If mysqld gets a packet that is too large or incorrect, it assumes that something has gone wrong with the client and closes the connection.
	To fix, you can increase the maximal packet size limit max_allowed_packet in my.cnf file, eg. set max_allowed_packet = 128M, then restart your MySQL server: sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart

AFM Plugin cannot be installed. PHP debug log does not reveal much, if anything. At best, generic warning about invalid supplied argument in foreach() loop.

MySQL Debug log reveals Error 2006 - MySQL Server Gone Away

	Increasing/Changing:

	wait_timeout directive => 28800 sec
	interactive_timeout => 28800 sec
	max_allowed_packet => 128M

	DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM!

So, what is the cause of it?
The cause was /piwik/ 3.x installation inside osclass.work folder, that was simply too large for a budget server to handle.
In order to successfully INSTALL the plugin in the first place, index.php file had to be modified and directly insert 'piwik' directory bypass.
