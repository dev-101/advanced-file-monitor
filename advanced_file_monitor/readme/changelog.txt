	REMAINING ISSUES
	* removing dir scan lowers empty dir creation security
	* issue with INCLUDE EXTENSIONS list lowers security for non-extension and unknown extension files
	* SKIP DIRECTORIES form @ admin settings page must be filled in linear order (complex AND logic)

3.0
index.php | remove directory scan | issues with exclude directory array
index.php | fix excludeDir path array | Why I reverted back to file-only mode & removed directory scan? Because of present issues with multiple directories inside array + subdirectories of defined dirs were still scanned. Additionally, file extensions do not properly work on scans with directories ON (empty extensions -> could isDir solve this problem?)
index.php | include Extensions
admin_settings.php | admin re-style
admin_view_changes | unify file rename

	REMAINING ISSUES
