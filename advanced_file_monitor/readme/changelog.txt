4.4
System Path :: Base Scan Path change detection & error flash message warning (e.g. when renaming root Osclass directory or tranferring installation to another domain)
index.php | Change debug hook priority to lowest level (10)

4.3
replace osc_contact_email() with admin loop [send email alerts to all admins]

4.2
index.php | empty email report failsafe mechanism

4.1
index.php | remove $sOptions array completely + define separate osc_set_preference() settings inside database

4.0
index.php | remove excludeDir directory array + define separate osc_set_preference() settings inside database
index.php | rewrite iterator function to reflect dir changes - now working properly with no foreach() loop any more subdirs are excluded as well as the defined root ex dirs
index.php | warning-sign.png image update & filename rename
admin_settings.php | admin re-style + update form code

	REMAINING ISSUES
	* removing dir scan lowers empty dir creation security
	* issue with INCLUDE EXTENSIONS list lowers security for non-extension and unknown extension files
	* SKIP DIRECTORIES form @ admin settings page must be filled in linear order (complex AND logic)

3.0
index.php | remove directory scan | issues with exclude directory array
index.php | fix excludeDir path array | Why I reverted back to file-only mode & removed directory scan? Because of present issues with multiple directories inside array + subdirectories of defined dirs were still scanned. Additionally, file extensions do not properly work on scans with directories ON (empty extensions -> could isDir solve this problem?)
index.php | include Extensions
admin_settings.php | admin re-style
admin_view_changes | unify file rename

	REMAINING ISSUES
	* multiple exclusion directory array | iterator does not exclude subdirs as well (oc-uploads is obvious problem here)
